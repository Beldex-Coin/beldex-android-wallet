        <h3>1.Use of the BELDEX Wallet</h3>
        <p>
          The BELDEX Wallet app (hereinafter, referred to as the "App") allows the use of accessing the Beldex Blockchain/network. You are not authorized, and nor should you rely on the App for legal advice, business advice, or advice of any kind. You act at your own risk in reliance on the contents of the App. Should you make a decision to act or not act you should contact a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction in which you want or need help. In no way are the owners of, or contributors to, the App responsible for the actions, decisions, or other behaviour taken or not taken by you in reliance upon the App.
         </p>
        <h3>2.Translations</h3>
        <p>
          The App may contain translations of the English version of the content available on the App. These translations are provided only as a convenience. In the event of any conflict between the English language version and the translated version, the English language version shall take precedence. If you notice any inconsistencies, please report them on GitHub.
         </p>
        <<h3> 3.Risks related to the use of the BELDEX Wallet.</h3>
        <p>

       (2) Software problems of the App and/or any Beldex-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the App and/or any Beldex-related software or service.
